# TicTacToeAI

TicTacToeAI is a personal project that I am working on to help me learn program design in a more challenging and interactive way.

## Installation
TicTacToeAI will be released as a CLI application hopefully in the near future.

## Usage
When prompted that it is your turn, you must enter the row and column of the space that you would like to take.
The board is numbered like this:
```bash
  1 2 3  
1 X|X|X
  -+-+-
2 X|X|X
  -+-+-
3 X|X|X
```
So to play the top right corner you would respond with "1", then "3".
```bash
row: 1
col: 3

 | |X
-+-+-
 | |
-+-+-
 | | 
```
